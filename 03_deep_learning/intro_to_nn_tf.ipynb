    "In this notebook, you'll get introduced to [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), an open source library to help you develop and train machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow in a lot of ways behaves like the arrays you love from NumPy. NumPy arrays, after all, are just tensors. TensorFlow takes these tensors and makes it simple to move them to GPUs for the faster processing needed when training neural networks. TensorFlow can also calculate gradients automatically, which is perfect for backpropagation, and has  intuitive high-level APIs specifically for building neural networks."

The networks are built from individual parts approximating neurons, typically called units or simply \"neurons.\" Each unit has some number of weighted inputs. These weighted inputs are summed together (a linear combination) then passed through an activation function to get the unit's output.\n",
